# System Administrator Guides

- **These guides will be a collection of the things I learn about networking tools, file management, and some other basic system administrator related things.**

*Note: I am not a professional System Administrator. [Like I've said](../README.md), my guides are a way to document my own progress, remember how to do things, and to teach people as I learn. Follow everything I do at your own risk.
