# Based Bot

## What is Based Bot?

- Based Bot is the Discord bot created by [5late](https://github.com/5late) to keep track of how based (and cringe) users are.

## How can I become more based?

- To become more based, *another* user must call you based. The syntax **MUST** follow as shown:

``Based @you``

- If everything goes well, the bot should react to the based message with a :thumbsup: emote.
- Your based score will rise by 1.

## Anti-Spam

- The bot has a 3 second cooldown on each 'based' message. 
- You cannot get called 'based' by the same user twice in a row.
- Spamming the bot *will* result in you getting blacklisted. Blacklists are *usually* permanent, and I do not care how much you cry, shouldn't have spammed.
- If spam is suspected, I will reset your based/cringe counter to 0.

## Commands

- Check how based you are with ``./mybasedcount``, this should return:
    - Based Score
    - Based Title
    - Cringe Score
    - Cringe Title
    - Time last called Based/Cringe
    - Badges

- ``./whoami`` should return a quick rundown of the bot (same as ``./help``)
- Check how based someone else is with ``./basedcount @person``, this should return all the same info as ``./mybasedcount``
- Check your profile settings with ``./settings``
- *Change* your profile settings with ``./settings SETTING NEWVALUE``, accepted SETTINGS are:
    - Public Profile
        - True/False
        - Public/Private
    - Show Badges on Profile
        - True/False

- You will be pinged at Q&A time, if you submitted a question.
- Questions can be related to the bot, development, how you can help, Pol Com, or anything else that interests you.

- Use the ``./ask`` command, as explained above.
- Ping bot creator in the server channels, if I'm around, and your question isn't stupid, I'll answer.

## Development

- I am planning to make the bot **fully open source**, and would appreciate pull requests with helpful changes.
- The bot is developed in 100% Python, please have a general idea of Python before staring any development.

## Donate

- I plan to make the bot open source so I can be completely transparent, as well as because I advocate for Free Open Source Software (FOSS)
- Your donations are greatly appreciated, and keep the bot server alive.
- I will update this page with links to donate in the near future.
