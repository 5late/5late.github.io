# Based Bot

## What is Based Bot?

- Based Bot is the Discord bot created by [5late](https://github.com/5late) to keep track of how based (and cringe) users are.
- Read Based Bot's Privacy Policy [here](https://gist.github.com/5late/3b722759646efc31ecbc0a2ffaa8ee74)

## How can I become more based/cringe?

- To become more based/cringe, *another* user must call you based/cringe. The syntax **MUST** follow as shown:

``Based @you``
or
``Cringe @you``

- Note: The person can also reply to your message with the word "Based/Cringe"

- If everything goes well, the bot should react to the based message with a :thumbsup: emote.
- Your based score will rise by 1.

## Anti-Spam

- The bot has a 3 second cooldown on each 'based' message. 
- You cannot get called 'based' by the same user twice in a row.
- Spamming the bot *will* result in you getting blacklisted. Blacklists are *usually* permanent, shouldn't have spammed.
- If soft spam is suspected, I will reset your based/cringe counter to 0.

## Commands

- Check how based you are with ``./mybasedcount``, this should return:
    - Based Score
    - Based Title
    - Cringe Score
    - Cringe Title
    - Time last called Based/Cringe
    - Badges
    - Based to Cringe Ratio
    - An image, depending on whether your Based-Cringe Ratio is positive or not

- ``./whoami`` should return a quick rundown of the bot (same as ``./help``)
- Check how based someone else is with ``./basedcount @person``, this should return all the same info as ``./mybasedcount``
- Check your profile settings with ``./settings``
- *Change* your profile settings with ``./settings SETTING NEWVALUE``, accepted SETTINGS are:
    - Public Profile
        - True/False
        - Public/Private
    - Show Badges on Profile
        - True/False
