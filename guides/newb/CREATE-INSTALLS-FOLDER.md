# Create an Installs Folder

Creating an installs folder for git repos that you may clone to install packages is a good idea to keep your ~/ directory clean.

It's up to you what you want to name the directory, but for the rest of the guides, the installs directory will be referred to as ``~/installs/``.

To create it, simply run ``cd`` to go back to your home directory, then run ``mkdir installs`` to create the folder.

You can now use the folder to hold all of your installation git repos or other install shell scripts.
