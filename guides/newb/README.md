# New User Linux Guides

Welcome to GNU/Linux!

Below are some guides I have wrote for users who are new to GNU/Linux. The guides assume you have completed the installation process of whichever distro you are using.

As far as possible, I will try to put commands for both Debian and Debian-based distros, as well as for Arch and Arch-based distros. For RHEL/Cent OS, I have not used those operating systems, and cannot provide help. The commands may or may not work.
