# New User Linux Guides

Welcome to GNU/Linux!

Below are some guides I have wrote for users who are new to GNU/Linux. The guides assume you have completed the installation process of whichever distro you are using.

As far as possible, I will try to put commands for both Debian and Debian-based distros, as well as for Arch and Arch-based distros. For RHEL/Cent OS, I have not used those operating systems, and cannot provide help. The commands may or may not work.

If you would like to become better with the command line, and want some basic scripts to start out, consider my [Newb-Config.](https://github.com/5late/Newb-Config) You can see the README [here.](./Newb-Config/README.md)
